# Wildlife Tracker App Using Java Spark Program

### This project is about Wildlife Tracker App Using Java Program, LTS Date: 2nd Feb 2024.

### Author:**Noel Shibanda*

## Description
- This project is my week three Java IP about Wildlife Tracker App.

## What is Wildlife Tracker App?
- The Forest Service is considering a proposal from a timber company to clearcut a nearby forest of Douglas Fir.
- Before this proposal may be approved, they must complete an environmental impact study.In this regards,the app has been developed.
- The Wildlife Tracker App is a web application built to help Rangers track wildlife sightings in a specific area.
- The application allows Rangers to record sightings of animals and endangered animals, along with relevant information such as location and Ranger details.
- It also provides features like reporting exceptions and storing timestamps for each sighting.


## BDD
- Categories of Wildlife
- The application tracks two categories of wildlife:

- Regular Animals:
    * Regular Animal ID.
    * Name.
    * Health:Okay or healthy.
    * Age:Adult or Middle age

- Endangered Animals:
    * Endangered Animal ID.
    * Animal Name
    * Health (Options: "healthy", "ill", "okay")
    * Age (Options: "newborn", "young", "adult")

- Sightings
    * When a wildlife species is spotted, a Ranger can submit a Sighting form containing the following details:
    * ID of Regular Animal or Endangered Animal species
    * Location (Conveyed in any manner chosen, e.g., "Zone A", "Near the River", "NE Quadrant", or latitude and longitude values)
    * Ranger Name ,badge number, contact information.

## Steps for the problem
- Enter the details that include and not limited to:
- Enter Regular animals name
- Enter Endangered Animals:
    * Name
    * Health (Options: "healthy", "ill", "okay")
    * Age (Options: "newborn", "young", "adult")
- Add a new ranger in the Database.
- Add a new location in the Database.

- Report/Record Sightings
  When a wildlife species is spotted, a Ranger can submit a Sighting form containing the following details:
* Regular animal or Endangered Animal species
* Location (Conveyed in any manner chosen, e.g., "Zone A", "Near the River", "NE Quadrant", or latitude and longitude values)
* Ranger Name:Ranger's details should include contact information, a badge number, etc


## **Expected output is either**
- After running the main App.java on IntelliJ IDEA,the user goes to the browser localhost 4567.
- The User end interface is loaded where:
- Get your output which includes:
* View a list of Relugar animal and be able to delete.
* View a  of Endagered animal and be able to delete.
* View a list of the Sighting Report/recording which includes:
    - Animal category(Regular/Endangered animal).
    - Animal name.
    - Location animal was sighted.
    - The ranger with name,badge number & contact who recorded the sighting.
    - Time stamp the sighting was recorded.
* View a list of Locations with Zone name, Zone Description,Zone Quadrant,Number of sightings.
* View a list of all the rangers with the Rangers name,Rangers badge number,Rangers description,Number of rangers sighting for the day.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
- Create a Database using CREATE DATABASE wildlife_tracker;
  \l -lists the database that have been created
  \c -connects to the created database.
- Run the code using the Intellij IDEA and go to the browser and run the Front/User end output on localhost:4567.
- Ensure that dependencies are installed on build.gradle.These icludes:
- Dependencies:
     // JUnit 5
    testImplementation platform('org.junit:junit-bom:5.9.1')
    testImplementation 'org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter'

    // Spark Java
    implementation 'com.sparkjava:spark-core:2.10.1'
    implementation 'com.sparkjava:spark-template-handlebars:2.7.1'
    implementation 'com.sparkjava:spark-template-velocity:2.7.1'

    // PostgreSQL JDBC Driver
    implementation 'org.postgresql:postgresql:42.2.5' 

    // Gson
    implementation 'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.8.9' 

    // SLF4J Simple Logger
    implementation 'org.slf4j:slf4j-simple:2.0.7'

    // SQL2o
    implementation 'org.sql2o:sql2o:1.6.0'

    // Apache Velocity
    implementation 'org.apache.velocity:velocity:2.3.0' 


- If the project has no errors, it will execute as expected.

## Psql commands used include:
- CREATE DATABASE wildlife_tracker;
    * \l -lists the database that have been created
    * \c -connects to the created database

## For Regular Animal table
- CREATE TABLE regular_animal(regular_animal_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, animalName varchar, health varchar, age varchar, deleted boolean default false);
- CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS regular_animal(regular_animal_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, animalName varchar, health varchar, age varchar, deleted boolean default false);
- CREATE TABLE regular_animal(regular_animal_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, animalName varchar, health varchar, age varchar, deleted boolean default false);
- INSERT INTO regular_animal(animalName, health, age, deleted) VALUES (UPPER(:animalName), :health, :age, false);
- UPDATE regular_animal SET deleted = (true) WHERE animalName = (:animalName);

- SELECT * FROM locations WHERE not deleted;
- UPDATE locations SET deleted = (true) WHERE zones_name = (:zones_name);

## Further Explorations
Consideratin of adding any combination of the following additional features:
- Build a Ranger class. This could include contact information, a badge number, etc. then, associate each Sighting with a Ranger object instead of just a name. Include a page where users may see all Rangers, and click each to see which Sightings they have reported.
- Build a Location class. Associate each Sighting with a Location object instead of just including a location property. Include a page where users may see all Locations in the area, and click one to see all Sightings reported in that region.
- Integrate a drop-down menu that allows the Ranger to select which animal species they have seen.
- Format timestamps for each sighting, and display in your front-end user interface.
- Allow users to sort Sightings by most recent.
- Implement a many-to-many relationship. Assume a sighting may now include multiple species, and animals may be included in multiple sightings.
  Important: If you update your database structure in any fashion, do not forget to update your README's database setup instructions, including the exact setup steps required to re-create your database.
- Brainstorm other errors or misuses of the application that could occur, and include additional exceptions to combat them.
